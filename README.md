## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Through this exercise, I understood the importance of setting background image properties in CSS.
I learnt concepts on how to manipulate background images with emphasis on background-position and background-repeat
I saw the overwhelming need to understand the working principles of "POSITION" attributes (fixed, relative and absolute)

This project was carried out with a mobile-first approach. The picture below shows a camparison of the exercise given to the solution I came up with.

### Continued development

As part of my 20-frontendMentor project challenge series, here is project 2 of 20 ... yaay!

There is need to cross-check code to spot repetition so as to avoid redundancy.
